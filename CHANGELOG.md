# Changelog

## [1.5.1] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Extra data categories in `get`**: `openplantbook.get` service now accepts an `include` parameter to request extra
  data categories (e.g., `care`) from the API.
- **AGENTS.md**: new guidance file for AI agents working in this repository.

### Changed

- **Include parameter aligned with upstream v1.5.0**: `include` is parsed as a comma-separated list (whitespace
  trimmed, duplicates removed) and sent to the API as a sorted string (e.g. `" care , poison "` → `care,poison`).
- **Subset-based include caching**: one cache entry per species tracks which extra categories are already satisfied via
  `_fetched_includes`. A plain `get` reuses a cached entry that already has `care`; requesting new categories (e.g.
  `care` after a base fetch) triggers a refetch. Matches
  [Olen/home-assistant-openplantbook v1.5.0](https://github.com/Olen/home-assistant-openplantbook/releases/tag/v1.5.0).
- **Cache bypass**: `cache: false` clears and refetches the species entry even when all requested `include`
  categories are already satisfied.
- **Cache cleanup logic**: `clean_cache` iterates species entries directly (single entry per species under the new
  model).
- **Error handling cleanup**: cache sentinel entries are cleared on API errors; a `finally` block ensures in-flight
  placeholders are removed when a fetch does not complete.
- **Upload validator**: switched from `isinstance(supported_unit, (list, tuple, set))` to
  `isinstance(supported_unit, list | tuple | set)` for consistency.
- **Tests**: added upstream-compatible coverage for `_parse_includes`, include API params, subset caching, cache
  bypass with `include`, and care fields on entity attributes.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Cache bypass** for the `get` service: pass `cache: false` to force-fetch plant data from the API, bypassing the local cache. Useful for "Force refresh" workflows in plant integrations.
- **Home Assistant language support**: optionally send the configured HA language (ISO 639-1) to the OpenPlantbook API so common plant names are returned in the user's language. Controlled via the new `use_ha_language` option (enabled by default).
- **Plant sensor monitoring**: upload process now detects stale sensors (no updates in >24h) and sensors with no valid data, with optional persistent UI notifications grouped by plant.
- **Configurable upload warnings**: new `notify_upload_warnings` option to enable persistent notifications when sensor issues or upload gaps are detected.
- **Upload schedule randomization**: each integration instance now picks a random time of day for its daily upload (seeded from the entry ID), spreading load across the OpenPlantbook API instead of all instances uploading simultaneously.
- **Rate limit error handling**: all service calls (`get`, `search`, `upload`) now catch `RateLimitError` and surface it as a `HomeAssistantError` instead of crashing.
- **Authentication error handling**: `PermissionError` from the SDK (expired/invalid tokens) is now caught and raised as `InvalidAuth`, prompting the user to reconfigure.
- **Image download error handling**: `PermissionError` when writing downloaded plant images is now caught and logged instead of crashing.
- **Extended conductivity unit support**: `µS/cm` (micro sign U+00B5) and `μS/cm` (Greek mu U+03BC) variants are now accepted alongside the standard `MICROSIEMENS_PER_CM` unit.
- **New test coverage**: tests for rate limit errors and permission/auth errors in service calls, plus expanded uploader tests.

### Changed
- **SDK**: `openplantbook-sdk` bumped from 0.4.7 to 0.6.1.
- **Repository**: ownership transferred from `@Olen` to `@slaxor505`; all documentation/issue tracker URLs updated accordingly.
- **Base URL**: API client now explicitly receives `PLANTBOOK_BASEURL` rather than relying on SDK defaults.
- **Upload restart delay**: increased from 5 minutes to 4 hours after HA restart before the first scheduled upload.
- **First-time upload window**: expanded from 1 day to 2 days of historical data.
- **Image filename parsing**: now uses `urllib.parse.urlparse` to extract the path from image URLs, fixing filenames for URLs with query parameters.
- **Info message logic**: fixed so the one-off upgrade notification triggers on message version change rather than only on first install.
- **Upload "no data" warnings**: no longer restricted to specific weekdays — stale/missing sensor warnings can fire any day.
- **Logging**: switched from f-string formatting to `%`-style lazy formatting throughout for better performance and HA log standards compliance.
- **Tests**: refactored uploader tests with reusable `mock_upload_env` fixture; removed inline mocks.

### Removed
- `GUI.md` example documentation and associated assets.
- `TODO.txt` task list.
- `FLOW_UPLOAD_DATA` constant (replaced by refactored config flow). The old upload-data-only notification check was replaced by the new combined info message.
